      content={`Hi, I’m Monika Singh
A fashion designer, illustrator, print designer, and visual designer with the heart of an artist and the curiosity of a collector. I’m equally fascinated by the precision of design and the fluidity of art, finding joy in the balance between structure and spontaneity. For me, design is not just a profession — it’s a way of observing, connecting, and translating the world into experiences people can feel.`}

      content={`My Journey

    I began with a Bachelor’s in Fashion Design at the Footwear Design and Development Institute, where I honed my skills in fashion illustration, surface prints, styling, and product development. Over time, my love for visual storytelling deepened, leading me to pursue a Master’s in Communication Design at Dhirubhai Ambani University, where I continue to expand my creative language.

      content={`But design, for me, extends far beyond client briefs. It lives in the quiet photographs of skies I can’t resist capturing, in the shoes-on-soil snapshots from walks that clear my mind, in the movies I return to for comfort, the books that shift my perspective, the webtoons that make me smile, and the music that speaks what I can’t put into words. It’s also in the quotes I hope everyone reads at least once — the ones that make you pause.`}

      content={`This is more than a portfolio — it’s a living space.
      Here, you’ll find my work, my art, and pieces of my creative process, side-by-side with the things that inspire me: random lists, visual experiments, playful ideas, and thoughtful reflections.
      It’s a space that changes as I do — a digital garden of sorts — where projects grow, thoughts bloom, and every corner holds something unexpected.

      If you’ve found your way here, consider this an open door. Wander through, explore freely, and if something resonates — let’s talk, create, or simply share ideas.
      Everything you can imagine is real — and this is mine. Welcome in.
